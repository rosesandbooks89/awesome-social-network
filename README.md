## Struggles and Sources
This project was relatively easy. I was able to use the grading criteria to figure out how to setup all my code, routes,schemas and controllers. I did have trouble with creating a thought and have it attached to the user but the answer was easy that i forgot to add the userId as one of the items in the json. I refered to the module and the class activities to help me with this project.
